# IBM-HR-Analytics---Attrition

Employee Attrition is the loss of an employee through a naturally occurring event/process.

The disadvantages of Employee Attrition:

Reduced size of workforce:
Exiting an employee – and not filling the vacancy – obviously means a smaller workforce. This could present problems when taking on tasks, and also translate to an increased workload volume for the remaining employees

Potential to be costly:
If attrition occurs for reasons of job elimination then the savings is planned and realized; however, if there is a sudden, unexpected event such as the death of an employee, cost and risk will present itself (e.g.; a high profile client who preferred dealing with this employee and now decides to leave).

In this project, we will predict attrition rate based on various features in employee data set
